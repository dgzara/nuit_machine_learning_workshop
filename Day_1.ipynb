    "### Why scikit-learn?\n",
    "Scikit-learn is an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning. It also provides various tools for model fitting, data preprocessing, model selection and evaluation, and many other utilities. It has a standardized and simple interface for preprocessing data and model training, optimization and evaluation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are we teaching machine learning with scikit-learn?\n",
    "Using machine learning is becoming a mandatory new skill for many professional workers. As work and organizations demand more use of data analyses, machine learning allows us to analyze large datasets to extract meaningful information. Although machine learning techniques have been there for decades, modern programming languages are making these techniques available for thousands of users. Rather than developing each method from scratch, *scikit-learn* offers a simple way to implement them with our datasets. This package provides a easy toolkit to master and leverage machine learning skills. We hope that learning sckikit-learn helps you comprehend the overall process of data transformation: from curating and importing datasets, to curating models for data knowledge purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of the Workshop\n",
    "The workshop is divided into 5 days:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduction to scikit-learn\n",
    "2. Supervisded learning: Classification models\n",
    "3. Unsupervised learning: Clustering models\n",
    "4. Data cleaning / transformation\n",
    "5. Model selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will start with an overview of *scikit-learn.* We will load datasets, create training and testing datasets, create a model, and evaluate it. We will delve into the functions, models, and details these days. However, keep in mind that this workshop's content will stay at an introductory level. If you are interested in learning more, here are some good resources that you can explore:\n",

When we have thousands of obsevations, machine learning models helps us automatize, scale, and guarantee the reproducibility these coding processes. The basic steps are:\n",

    "## 1. Gathering data\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is collecting data and understanding the dataset. This step is very important because the quality and quantity of data that you gather will directly determine how good your predictive model can be. Also, many machine learning models are *biased* because of the data. A well-known example is [this face-generator model](https://www.theverge.com/21298762/face-depixelizer-ai-machine-learning-tool-pulse-stylegan-obama-bias) that did not recognize President Obama as an African-American person. \n",
    "\n",
    "You need to collect data and take into account these recommendations:\n",
    "* **Number of observations (*N*):** In statistics, there is a theorem called \"Law of Big Numbers.\" According to this law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value. In other words, by having a large number of observations, your model will tend to become closer to the expected value. Creating machine learning models is based on *big datasets.* Imagine companies that collect big data from their clients and are able to get a clear picture of them. Prediciton becomes more accurate as long as you have more observations and knowledge of your population. \n",
    "* **Missing data**: Many observations may lack some values. You can have multiple reasons for this: data-collection issues, restricted data, information not available, etc. It is important to make strategies whenever you have missing data. \n",
    "* **Representativity**: One main problem in most datasets is checking how representative is the dataset with respect to the population. How can we be sure that the dataset is not baised? Computers do not understand the dataset context, or how the dataset was collected. This problem lies on the people who collected the data. Moreover, people who got the data must be aware about any potential flaws or inequealities in the dataset. Descriptive analysis should guide any checkings and validation processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we will use the datasets provided by *scikit-learn*. You can check other [toy datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html) if you are interested in exploring more. These datasets are well-known, public, and used frequently for learning and testing purposes."
